# Deep-Learning-APL745-
Basic Machine Learning Codes written from scratch in Python.

## [Non-Linear Regression](https://github.com/sob-ANN/Deep-Learning-APL745-/blob/main/Non-Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
Polynomial Regression applied to solve a simple problem of projectile motion. Use of Batch/Mini-batch/Stocastic Gradient Descent from scratch and plotting Number of Epochs vs Cost Function plots. Also, using a variable learning rate optimized by Line Search Algorithm

## [Multivariate Regression](https://github.com/sob-ANN/Deep-Learning-APL745-/blob/main/Multivariate%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
Multivariate Regression using Gradient Descent to predict house prices.

## [Binary Classification](https://github.com/sob-ANN/Deep-Learning-APL745-/blob/main/Binary%20Classification-Logistic%20Reg.ipynb)
Binary Classification of data containing multiple features which affect rainfall. Using that data we make predictions on a test set whether it will rain tomorrow or not.
We use logistic Regression as our hypothesis function and Binary Cross Entropy loss. Optimized using scipy library.
